# pending-payment
Repository useful for Freelancers when his/ her client delays the payment on committed date. It takes start date and number of days remaining as the inputs and fades the website as the days moves towards expiry day. On last day, entire website will display just a white screen.

Put the pending-payment.js file in your application assets folder or wherever you keep js files and then include this file in HEAD tag of webpage as,
<script src="path to file.../pending-payment.js"></script>

Note: Inspired by not-paid.js and developed for fun
